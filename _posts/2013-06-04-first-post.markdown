The very first post to a blog is always difficult even for such an intellectual masterclass like myself so i'll keep it short and sweet.

Here you will find mainly me ranting about things I either passionately love or actively dislike, some of which may be interesting, most of which will be passive aggressively vented rage. It can vary from current affairs to experiences within my life, last nights England performance to how Google's Penguin 2.0 update effected ranking performance. 

This blog is vast in different topics all covered by yours truly and I hope you'll find something that will tickle your fancy.

If you have anything you'd like me to cover in a blog post I'd love to hear from you. I can be reached [by email](mailto:samhagerty@gmail.com) or [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/SamSteveHagerty).
