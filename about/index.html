  <p>A Bristol based Web Developer and Designer, with excellent taste, supreme social standing, devilishly handsome, sharp witted, wickedly intelligent and rather modest.</p>

  <p>You will find me mainly working for the fantastic <a href="http://www.dfsales.co.uk">DF Sales</a> managing and improving the website with the rest almost overly intellectual web team.</p>

  <p>Though the Interweb is a large passion of mine this is not my only hobby or interest as you will probably notice from the blog posts on this site. Rather than list my other many talents and interests like every other person with a blog does why not flick through my blog posts if you haven't already and learn a little more about myself through there. Remember kids, self learning is the best kind of learning.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to get in touch regarding anything at all, please email me <a href="mailto:samhagerty@gmail.com">samhagerty@gmail.com</a> or send me a cheeky message <a href="http://twitter.com/SamSteveHagerty">@SamSteveHagerty</a> on Twitter.</p>
